# OpenShift Project Tools

Welcome to the OpenShift project tools repository!

Here you will find tools to help you manage, automate, and maintain your OpenShift projects and pipelines.

The resources found in this repository will (should) be in a constant state of evolution as the community as a whole contributes their experiences using the existing tools and breaks new ground solving issues.

For this to happen we need your support.  Please contribute!  Whether that be with your experiences or with the code you used to solve a particular issue.

To contribute directly, please fork the repo and submit pull requests.

Thank-you and enjoy.
